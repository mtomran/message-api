# Models
We are using [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) as MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution 
to model your application data. It includes built-in 
type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks 
and more, out of the box.
